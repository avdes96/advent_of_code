# What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code (AoC) is an advent calendar style coding challenge held in December. Each day contains a problem that can be solved by writing code. Each problem contains two parts; part 2 is unlocked after part 1 is complete. Solving each part nets one star. The problems typically get harder each day.

From 2015 to 2024, problems ran from the 1<sup>st</sup> to the 25<sup>th</sup>; in 2025 problems are running from the 1<sup>st</sup> to the 12<sup>th</sup>. There are currently 524 total stars to collect.

# About this repo

This repo contains my solutions for the AoC problems. My aim is for the code to follow good design principles, and to use relatively efficient algorithms where possible (i.e., not just brute force). My solutions are written in Python.

# Progress Tracker

This tracker records the number of solutions (for **parts** or **stars**) uploaded to this repo.

# Usage

For year `20YY` and day `DD`, save the problem input in a file in the directory `20YY/day_DD`. \
Then from the root directory run:

```bash
python 20YY/day_DD/solution.py <your-input-file>
```

replacing `<your-input-file>` with your actual input file path.
