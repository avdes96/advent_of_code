# What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code (AoC) is an advent calendar style coding challenge held in December. Each day from the 1<sup>st</sup> to the 25<sup>th</sup> contains a problem that can be solved by writing code. Each problem contains two parts; part 2 is unlocked after part 1 is complete. Solving each part nets one star; the aim is to collect all 50 stars in a given year. The problems typically get harder each day.

AoC has been running since 2015, and so recently completed its 10<sup>th</sup> year. There are currently 500 total stars to collect.

# About this repo

This repo contains my solutions for the AoC problems. My aim is for the code to follow good design principles, and to use relatively efficient algorithms where possible (i.e., not just brute force). My solutions are written in Python.

# Progress Tracker

This tracker records the number of solutions (for **parts** or **stars**) uploaded to this repo.

# Usage

For year `YYYY` and day `DD`, save the problem input in a file called `input.txt` in the directory `YYYY/day_DD`. \
Then from the root directory run:

```bash
python 20YY/day_DD/solution.py
```
